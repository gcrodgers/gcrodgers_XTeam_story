There once was a boy named Garrett. He used to live in Illinois. He wanted to go to UW-Madison, so he moved to Wisconsin in 2016. He started school at Madison in 2019. Garrett likes computer science and astronomy.
Now he takes CS 400 this semester, in his x team there are other 3 people Will, Ethan, and Sam. This week we are working on p2, it required to create a Binary search tree and Red-Black Tree.


Ethan was a SDE in Taiwan before here, he love Java and OS very much. In this semester, there are
other 3 members Will, Sam, and Garret in our xteam.

Years later when a boy named Garrett had finished his studies. He was famous the world over for his advancements in space technology. He looked back at his time in college with his xteam, and remembered how they inspired him with a great fondness.

Garrett would go on to name some of his discoverys after his Xteam members. He would invite them to many gatherings, for without them he would not have made it!
